## 🎯 Deployment Process

### Phase 1: AWS Infrastructure Setup (Manual)
1. **Launch EC2 Instance** (RHEL 9, t2.micro+)
2. **Configure Security Groups** (SSH port 22, HTTP port 80)
3. **Create & Attach EBS Volume** for backups
4. **Upload project files** to EC2 instance

### Phase 2: Automated Deployment (One Command)
```bash
# On your EC2 instance, run:
sudo ./quick_start.sh
```

This single command will:
- ✅ Install all dependencies (Python, MariaDB, Node.js, Nginx, PM2)
- ✅ Secure MariaDB installation
- ✅ Create database and tables
- ✅ Mount backup volume
- ✅ Deploy and configure application
- ✅ Setup automated backups
- ✅ Start all services

## 🌐 Your Application URLs

After successful deployment:
- **Main App**: http://ec2-3-82-116-80.compute-1.amazonaws.com
- **API Documentation**: http://ec2-3-82-116-80.compute-1.amazonaws.com/api/docs
- **Health Check**: http://ec2-3-82-116-80.compute-1.amazonaws.com/health

## 🔧 Key Features

### Application Features
- ✅ Create, read, update, delete notes
- ✅ Automatic timestamps for all notes
- ✅ Clean, modern web interface
- ✅ RESTful API with auto-generated documentation
- ✅ Real-time data persistence

### Infrastructure Features
- ✅ Production-ready FastAPI backend
- ✅ MariaDB database with optimized configuration
- ✅ Nginx reverse proxy with security headers
- ✅ PM2 process management with auto-restart
- ✅ Systemd service integration
- ✅ Automated daily database backups
- ✅ EBS volume for backup storage
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoints

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
Internet → Security Group → EC2 Instance (RHEL 9)
                              ├── Nginx (:80) → FastAPI (:8000)
                              ├── MariaDB (:3306, localhost only)
                              ├── React Frontend (static files)
                              └── EBS Backup Volume (/backup)
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

- ✅ **Network Security**: Security groups restrict access appropriately
- ✅ **Database Security**: MariaDB user isolation, localhost binding
- ✅ **Application Security**: CORS configured, security headers
- ✅ **Process Isolation**: Dedicated `notes_app` user
- ✅ **Backup Security**: EBS encryption, secure backup storage

## 📈 Management & Monitoring

### Service Management
```bash
# Application status
sudo systemctl status notes-app nginx mariadb

# Application logs  
sudo -u notes_app pm2 logs

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart notes-app
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Manual backup
sudo -u notes_app /opt/notes_app/deploy/backup_mariadb.sh

# Restore from backup
sudo -u notes_app /opt/notes_app/deploy/restore_mariadb.sh

# Database access
mysql -u notes_user -p notes_db
```

### Backup Management
```bash
# List backups
ls -la /backup/mariadb/

# Check backup logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/notes-backup.log
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Review `AWS_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md`
- [ ] Ensure EC2 instance is ready
- [ ] Upload project files to EC2
- [ ] Run `./verify_files.sh` to confirm readiness

### 2. Deployment
- [ ] SSH into your EC2 instance
- [ ] Run `sudo ./quick_start.sh`
- [ ] Follow the guided prompts
- [ ] Test the application

### 3. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all services are running
- [ ] Test backup functionality
- [ ] Access application in browser
- [ ] Review logs and monitoring

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost/health

# Service status
sudo systemctl is-active nginx mariadb notes-app

# Database connectivity
mysql -u notes_user -p -e "SELECT 1;"

# Backup volume status
df -h /backup
```

### Common Issues
- **Application not accessible**: Check security groups and Nginx
- **Database connection errors**: Verify MariaDB status and credentials
- **Backup failures**: Ensure EBS volume is mounted at `/backup`
- **Service startup issues**: Check logs with `pm2 logs` and `journalctl`

### Getting Help
1. Check service logs (locations in documentation)
2. Review troubleshooting section in main README
3. Verify AWS infrastructure configuration
4. Use health check endpoints for diagnostics
